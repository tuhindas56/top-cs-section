# KnightsTravails

Knights Travails project, implemented as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails">The Odin Project curriculum</a>.

This project provides a solution to find the shortest path a knight on a chessboard needs to take to move from a starting position to a destination position using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

## Usage

To use the knightMoves function, call it with the starting and destination coordinates as follows:

```javascript
console.log(knightMoves([fromX, fromY], [destinationX, destinationY]))
```

### Parameters

- fromX: The starting x-coordinate (0 to 7).
- fromY: The starting y-coordinate (0 to 7).
- destinationX: The destination x-coordinate (0 to 7).
- destinationY: The destination y-coordinate (0 to 7).
